# MyBooksApp

In need of a APP to find your books? Your problem is **over**!

### Disclaimer:

This APP was developed as a challenge made by a company, all the credits to them! Link: https://github.com/FotonTech/frontend-challenge

## Running

### Prior to all, clone this repository.

### First, make sure you have the environment setup to run a React Native project.

### On this project, we used the bare workflow from Expo. You can install their CLI by running the followed command: `npm install --global expo-cli`

### Next, you can run `yarn install` (make sure you are in the right directory).

### Now you can run the following command to open the Expo Developer Tool: ` expo start --tunnel` ('--tunnel' flag sets expo to enable opening the APP from different network connections)

### After expo start, you can type `a` on your terminal to open your emulator, or read the QR Code from the terminal or the Expo Dev Tools web page.

## (Remember you need to install the expo go APP to run your in development APP)

### You can also run your APP in the React Native Vanilla version, just type `yarn android` or `yarn ios`.

## Now you're set to run MyBooksApp by yourself!
